  # We want to leverage the reusable workflow from bos cli as shown here, but
  # we need to temporarily use a modified version of that in order to support
  # tsx file deployment. We have copied the workflow here and modified it to
  # change all tsx files to jsx files before deploying. Once the bos cli
  # workflow is updated to support tsx files, we can remove this and use the
  # reusable workflow directly
