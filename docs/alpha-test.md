# BWE Alpha Test

## Intended Participants

- internal teams: FastAuth
- BOS power users: devhub, jutsu, everything, etc
- non-BOS web developers

## Goals

- BWE exposure to a wider variety of component code to discover perforance/capability shortcomings
- socialization of BWE with prolific BOS developers
- feedback on migration path from vanilla React to BWE and from Discovery VM to BWE
- feedback on syntax
- inform roadmap to production availability
- gather opinion of BWE from non-BOS devs
- kick off security audit efforts
- inform type of npm modules that are desired to be supported
- use feedback to re-evaluate priority on all backlog items

## Timeline

Towards the end of January we expect to be discussing concrete timing for the alpha test. This time was chosen because it is when we believe we will have made enough progress on kicking off CSS support that we will be able to estimate a completion date, and that is the last major feature dependency for the alpha test.

## Scope

We want to see a few major types of work completed during the test:
- new component code which tests advertised BWE capabilities that were not available under the VM
- new component code which tests the limits of BWE
- migration of VM component code from the VM to BWE
- migration of vanilla React components to BWE components

## Support from BWE team

The BWE team will be available via Telegram and GitHub to answer questions and assist in troubleshooting

## Feedback

We will be looking for feedback on the following:
- performance
- syntax
- documentation
- level of effort to migrate components to BWE
- missing capabilities

### Avenues of Feedback
- form at completion of alpha test
- GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests

## What to expect

### Should work
- npm dependencies including: React components, vanilla JS libs, etc (TODO)

### Not currently supported

TODO: link to issues for capabilities like `useRef`, Web APIs, etc
