# Contributing

## Branching

Branch directly off `main` and use an appropriate prefix (`feat/`, `chore/`, `fix/`, etc)

## PRs

Use [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) in PR descriptions to automatically close relevent issues when the PR is merged. E.g. `Closes #10`

## Syncing Component Updates with Engine Updates

As much as possible, please update demo components in `apps/demos` in the same PR as the engine modifications which necessitate the component updates. You may wish to get the engine change portion of your PR reviewed and approved before adding the component changes, in case review comments lead to alterations to the implementation or resultant syntax
