# Tools

Currently, the only tool which supports authoring and publishing BWE components is the BWE sandbox. This is a web-based development environment built by the BWE team at Pagoda.

The sandbox can be found at [bos-web-engine-sandbox.vercel.app](https://bos-web-engine-sandbox.vercel.app/)

Code for the sandbox can be found under `apps/sandbox` in the BWE repository [here](https://github.com/near/bos-web-engine/tree/main/apps/sandbox)

We look forward to supporting other tool developers as they adopt BWE.

  <summary>Want to build tooling for BWE?</summary>
  <p>The main thing to know is that BWE is still highly subject to change as we receive feedback on DevX and functionality. If you don't mind potential rework due to engine changes and want to start building now:</p>
  <p>Our sandbox package was built from the start to be reusable in other web implementations. Feel free to fork our project or pull out pieces you need. In the future we hope to publish many of our packages on NPM to make it easier to receive future updates.</p>
